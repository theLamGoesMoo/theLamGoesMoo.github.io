Though many moos may have different opinions about which album has the best songs, almost all will raise a white flag and agree that this one is a true masterpiece. Every song is a bop, and if you're ever feeling blue or need a chill playlist to study with, this album is for you. Get better day by day as you enjoy Mamamoo recovering 4 different ways from heartbreak in the city of Hong Kong."
